    "## Introduction\n",
    "In previous lab classes we have shown a pygame car race where we have manually controlled cars and also autonomous ones. In the autonomous we have implemented cars that are controlled by decision trees. The car that is controlled by decision trees presented in lab9 have 5 sensors which measure if the sensor position is on the road our outside of it (border or grass). These 5 sensors have fixed positions and are limited because they do not adapt to the road pattern. Cars are controlled by discrete actions like rotateLeft, rotateRight and move"

    "## Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project the idea is to model some cars, manually or autonomous ones, in different situations using machine learning techniques, namely machine learning classifiers. In order to model it is necessary to gather data from different races with the same car and learn a classifier like a decision tree or other that best reproduce the car behavior."

    "In contrast with the cars used in Lab9 that have fixed sizes and are a kind of color sensor that detect 3 types of materials, i.e., pixels: road, edge and grass, cars should be have radars that measure the distance towards the road edge. You might use 5 or more radars and each one has a maximum distace of range like in the figure above.\n",
    "Note that in clear contrast with the discrete sensors used in Lab9 shich possess discrete values (a range of 3 possible values) these radar sensors that measure ditance towards the grass will have float values"

    "To model a certain car, you need to automatically gather data from a set of race car performances in different situations that will be used in the leanring process. You do not need to change the circuit, but using the same circuit there is the possibility of same variation. For example, we can vary the initial directions of the cars in the sterting position or the position of the finish line and the race direction, that can be clockwise or anti-clockwise."

For example, in decision trees we can use pruning and there are different tree pruning techniques and parameters that might be used. You can use other classifier, for example nave bayes ones that can be useful in case you use the original fixed size color sensors with manually controlled cars."
